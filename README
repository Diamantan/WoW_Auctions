This is a site that tracks the average price of World of Warcraft auction items.
The cron job pulls the auctions and processes them for the frontend.

Requires:
 - Python 2.7+
 - SQLAlchemy
 - A database (I use postgresql, you can use whatever, just alter the models.py connection URI)
 - A fairly fast connection.
